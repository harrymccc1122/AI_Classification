welcome to our 292 demo!
- well be showing an app we built using python
	- that can determine if you are walking or jumping
		- based on a csv file of accelerometer data
	- application with health/fitness apps
		- to only count the time of your workout
			- when you are actually moving
- it uses accelerometer data
	- taken from phyphox the app 
- we collected data (voiceover)
	- different positions
		- left and right hand
		- left and right pant pocket
		- left and right jacket pocket
		- to get varied data so our classifier works 
			- no matter where the phone is placed
	- initially we recorded jumping and walking combined
		- made labeling process difficult
	- we then collected just jumping and then just walking
		- easy labeling and works well
	- we have total of 18 minutes of collected data
- now the app demo!
- next steps:
	- work live (fitness app)
	- get more training data
		- different phones, shoes, heights of ppl (+accurate)
